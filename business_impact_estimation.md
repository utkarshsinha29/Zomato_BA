# Business Impact Estimation

This section estimates the potential revenue impact of improving
checkout-to-payment conversion.

## Assumptions
- Monthly menu views: 500,000
- Current checkout-to-payment conversion: 50%
- Expected uplift from experiment: +3%
- Average Order Value (AOV): ₹600

## Impact Calculation

Current monthly orders:
500,000 × 50% = 250,000

Incremental orders after uplift:
500,000 × 3% = 15,000

Incremental monthly revenue:
15,000 × ₹600 = ₹9,000,000

Estimated annual impact:
₹9,000,000 × 12 = ₹108 Crore

## Conclusion
Even a small improvement in conversion can lead to significant
annual revenue uplift, justifying prioritization of this experiment.
