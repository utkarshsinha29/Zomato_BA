# Solution Prioritization

Solutions were prioritized using an Impact vs Effort framework.

| Solution | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Card payment retry & fallback | High | Medium | P1 |
| Checkout ETA visibility | High | Low | P1 |
| Menu UX improvements | Medium | Low | P2 |
| Delivery partner optimization | Medium | High | P3 |

## Prioritization Logic
- P1 initiatives deliver high business impact with manageable effort.
- P2 initiatives improve conversion but with lower immediate impact.
- P3 initiatives require operational changes and longer timelines.
